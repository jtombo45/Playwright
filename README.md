# Playwright QA Automation Case Study

This repository was created as part of a **take-home interview assignment** for a QA role, but more importantly, as a personal learning project to explore **QA testing**, **web automation**, and how tools like **Selenium** and **Playwright** operate in real-world scenarios.

While Selenium is a popular automation tool, I chose to leverage **Playwright** due to its modern API and ease of setup ‚Äî but the core concepts are transferable between both tools. This repo serves as a case study for anyone looking to understand automated browser testing and web scraping fundamentals.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Use **Playwright** to automate the extraction of the latest **100 articles** from the [YCombinator Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website.
- Overcome the pagination limitation where only **30 articles** are displayed per page.
- Demonstrate efficient, reliable scraping techniques within a QA automation framework.

This solution simulates what you'd typically build using Selenium, showcasing how automated browser tasks can be structured for both **testing** and **data extraction** purposes.
